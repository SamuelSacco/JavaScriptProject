# Maze Builder
https://samuelsacco.github.io/MazeBuilder/

Maze Builder will allow users to create their own unique mazes and watch different algorithms solve them. A cathartic and educational experience, the user can re position the start and end nodes to figure out which algorithm is faster. Paint, search, erase repeat.

# Functionality and MVP
* Select different algorithms
* "Search" starts the algorithm visualizer
* "Reset" resets everything
* "Clear walls" gets rid of any obstacles
* "Clear path" reverts visited tiles to their default state
* Change start and end tiles to see the difference

# Code Snippets
* setTimeout allows users to visualize the path the selected algorithm took to find the end tile
* clearTimeout allows users to stop the visualization
*
